%MDL_UR5 Create model of Universal Robotics UR3 manipulator
%
% MDL_UR5 is a script that creates the workspace variable ur3 which
% describes the kinematic characteristics of a Universal Robotics UR3 manipulator
% using standard DH conventions.
%
% Also define the workspace vectors:
%   qz         zero joint angle configuration
%   qr         arm along +ve x-axis configuration
%
% Reference::
% - https://www.universal-robots.com/articles/ur/parameters-for-calculations-of-kinematics-and-dynamics/
%
% Notes::
% - SI units of metres are used.
% - Unlike most other mdl_xxx scripts this one is actually a function that
%   behaves like a script and writes to the global workspace.
%
% See also mdl_ur5, mdl_ur10, mdl_puma560, SerialLink.
